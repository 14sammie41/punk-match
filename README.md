This is a simple memory based match game with a punk theme to keep things lively.

## User interactions

The idea is to have four punk style logo's or images showing on screen and then have to put them in relevant order as shown on previous screen.

## Wireframe of the site on all screen sizes:

I have sketched up the initial design in mobile, tablet and monitor sizes so that there is a baseline to work from. The bulk of the images will come from AI generation, so there will be no risk of plagiarism.

### Dependencies and Credits

This will be for dependencies as I go through this project - complete as they come through.
+ [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) has been used throughout the project to add items like a navbar and a footer. The main reason for this is to mitigate the need for written Javascript to create a responsive site. I have annotated throughout the project, the key areas this has been used.
+ [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/love-you-gesture) has been used to generate a quick to recognise image for a favicon meaning you can link it to the page in each tab.
+ [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/kits/524dbc89dc/setup) has been used to add icons and allow them to be easily edited.
+ [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/selection/embed) has been used to give a consistent font accross the site. I have chosen this font as it has a clean look but with a bit of a gothic style to it.
+ [Microsoft Image Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/image-creator) has been used to create images for the site, including the background and some of the more advanced tiles.
+ [IMGOnline](https://www.imgonline.com.ua/eng/get-dominant-colors.php) has been used to pull the dominant colours out of my 'milestone-1-background' image to create a baseline for the website.
+ [HTML and CSS3 for dummies book](https://www.dummies.com/article/technology/programming-web-design/html5/html5-and-css3-all-in-one-for-dummies-cheat-sheet-207788/) has been used as a booster on the Code Institute lesson content to enhance my learning and add some extra tips and tricks in.
+ [Coding with JavaScript for dummies book](https://www.dummies.com/article/technology/programming-web-design/javascript/javascript-for-dummies-cheat-sheet-207619/) has been used in addition to the above book to enhance my learning of JavaScript.
+ [Flaticon]("https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/punk") Has been used to generate some generic punk themed icons for my playing cards.

## Bug problems and solutions

These bugs were found as I was writing the code, not whilst testing, hence being at this point in the README file.

## Deployment process

Running the project locally:
1. Ensure you have a GitHub account [Create one here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github).
2. Use Google Chrome as the best browser for this deployment.
3. Install VSCode to your computer or open the browser version [here](https://vscode.dev/).
4. Click the 'Open Remote Repository' button on the home page to clone and or edit as you wish.

To do the above you may need to follow these steps also:
1. Open the repository in GitHub [here]()
2. Under the name, click 'clone or download'.
3. Once in the clone section copy the HTTP clone URL for the repository.
4. In the local IDE of your choice, open the terminal.
5. Change the current working directory to wherever you want it to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in step 3.

Deployment, step-by-step guide:
+ In GitHub, first, ensure all work is committed and pushed, then go to the settings tab on GitHub, then the Pages section on the left-hand navigation.
+ Once in the Pages section on GitHub change the branch drop down to 'Main' and then click the save option.
+ Now go back to the code section of GitHub and click the deployment link on the right-hand side. (You may need to refresh the page to see the deployment link)
+ Once on the deployment page on GitHub click on the provided link and it will open up the deployed project.

## Testing

As this milestone is all about JavaScript i will be doing more automated testing so therefore i will link to my test page below.

### Testing as a user for navigation purposes:
+ 

### Testing with validators:

+ For all bugs I encountered whilst writing my initial code please refer to the 'bugs section' further up this page.
